## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server

Local web server will use port 4100 instead of standard React's port 3000 to prevent conflicts with some backends like Node or Rails. You can configure port in scripts section of `package.json`: we use [cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) to set environment variable PORT for React scripts, this is Windows-compatible way of setting environment variables.
 
Alternatively, you can add `.env` file in the root folder of project to set environment variables (use PORT to change webserver's port). This file will be ignored by git, so it is suitable for API keys and other sensitive stuff. Refer to [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and [React](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) documentation for more details. Also, please remove setting variable via script section of `package.json` - `dotenv` never override variables if they are already set.  

### Making requests to the backend API

Configure the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable pointing to the backend local server's URL:

`export REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000/api"`


## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "c{api}tal". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication.

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
    - List of tags
    - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
    - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )
    - Use JWT (store the token in localStorage)
- Settings page (URL: /#/settings )
- Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )
- Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )
    - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
    - Render markdown from server client side
